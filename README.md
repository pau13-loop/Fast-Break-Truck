# Fast Break Truck

> In this repository you'll find **Fast Break Truck Kata**. This kata is the perfect introduction to make your first pattern design to develop your application. The best goal of this kata is that you will have a wide range of knowledge of the creational design patterns. Is not really difficult to complete but you'll have to spend some time doing research about the creational design patterns and ask yourself for the kind of application that you want to make and the expected behaviour of this one wich of the popular creational patterns will fit better with the logic of your app.

## Motivation

The biggest motivation for this project has been actually having the chance to choose a design pattern by your criteria. I think this fact is really interesting, and you should keep it on mind for whenever you have to develop an application. Don't be afraid if you never have created anyone before. You'll find lots of examples on internet and material that will make you path so much easier. In my case I started creating the UML diagram from the description of the application I had to code, and I should say that first make a UML diagram of the application I supposed I had to develop has made my work so much easier and so much pleasant. Get into the architecture of the application it's something always I've found really interesting and now I've founded really useful too.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

- You can clone objects without coupling it to its concrete class.
- Possibility to avoid initialization repeated code cloning created prototypes
- Allow you to create a complex object with more facility
- Alternative to the hierarchy because you can pre-config the object to obtain complex objects.


### Disadvantatges

- Clone complex objects with circular references can be a bit difficult
- How you must know the object class to make a duplicate from it, the code becomes dependent from this class

## Reflections

My opinion about this kata, I've founded so interesting the personal chance to create a UML Diagram by ourselves just by checking all the possible design patterns and choose one based in our criteria and our goals. I always like the freedom to try new things and how cool is when you discover something that you really like. In my case I've found so interesting the research that we had to do about the design patterns and about how they can influence on your app and the expected behaviour. Now I feel so much more confident of myself to build my own apps based on the architecture I thought could be the best one to the expected results. I think that even knowing that this kata is quite simple and advisable to everyone interested in code architecture, in my case I've found it really useful and so much profitable, for now and to my personal developer future. I really like thinking about the best possible architectures and how to build them from the design patterns of GoF.
